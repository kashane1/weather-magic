I enjoyed the process of this homework assignment because felt very close to what a real life project might require of me. I'm happy to be working with third party APIs even if they are a bit challenging at first. After some extra studying and a few youtube videos, I was able to get this API to do exactly what I wanted it to. The most challenging part was working with multiple API calls. I also made other small mistakes, typos really, that had me hung up for hours. It was a great practice in debugging and trying not to get too frustrated.
